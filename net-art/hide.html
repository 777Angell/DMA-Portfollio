<p>You hold your breath as Springtrap enters the room in search of you. He takes a long time inspecting everything about the room. But eventually gives up and continues down the hall. Now is your time to act, remember he is still in the vicinity.</p>

<a href="death5.html">Run towards that exit like there's no tomorrow! </a>
<p>Or</p>
<a href="escape.html">Slow and steadily make your way toward the exit.</a>
